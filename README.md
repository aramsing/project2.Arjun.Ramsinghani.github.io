# Arjun's Mirror Project
This is my project 2 for Human Computer Interaction Class

In case the presentation page does not display correctly, the readme file that displays correctly is on my repository.

# For Part C:
The following images are what I had in mind for how a smart mirror should look.

<img src ="https://github.com/aramsing/project2.Arjun.Ramsinghani.github.io/blob/main/Weather.png" width="400"> <img src ="https://github.com/aramsing/project2.Arjun.Ramsinghani.github.io/blob/main/Health.png" width="400">

The main page will have 6 buttons with different functionalities that a user might want to see.

Calender will show the days schedule to give a refresh on what they will be doing in the day.

Weather will show the day's temperature as well as the next few days. It will also show what the current temperature is so that the user can dress for the type of weather.

Health will show the users weight, sleep, as well as mirror time and how it compared for the week. For the sake of this project I did only sleep in my implementation.

News will show the most up to date news. The options for local, national, and sports news are meant to be links to take you to what you want to see.

Social Media will show your posts as well as friends posts, for example I did Twitter.

Messages will show your text messages that you get on your phone.
  
# For Part B:

This is how I implemented my design. I had used processing language for this implementation.
